🧬 Evolutionary GANs for Semi-Supervised Learning

Hybrid approach combining Generative Adversarial Networks with Multi-Objective 
Evolutionary Algorithms (NSGA-II) to train robust classifiers with extremely 
limited labeled data.

✨ Highlights:
- 10% higher accuracy than baseline GAN
- 97% reduction in training variance
- Works with as few as 60 labeled samples
- Maintains image generation quality (FID ~10)
- General framework applicable to any GAN architecture

📊 Results on MNIST: 96.7% accuracy with 1,000 labels (1.6% of dataset)
